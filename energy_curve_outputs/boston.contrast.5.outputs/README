From CSIQ Dataset, boston.contrast.5.png image is taken as input and it enhanced using Energy Curve Equalisation method with and without 
clipping the Energy Curve

Input Image:
boston.contrast.5.png

OutputImage:
boston.contrast.5_with_clipping_output.png          Enhanced image obtained by Clipping the energy curve
boston.contrast.5_without_clipping_output.png       Enhanced image obtained by without Clipping the energy curve


Conclusion:
With the clipping limit overenhancement is controlled and the natural appearance of the image is preserved, 
whereas without a clipping limit it results in over-enhancement and lacks the natural visual appearance of the image.
